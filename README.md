# data-structure
Lab practicals of data structures
- C++ Implementation

1. Write a menu driven program that implements following operations on a  linear array:
•	Insert a new element at a specified position
•	Delete an element either whose value is given or whose position is given
•	To find the location of a given element
•	To display the elements of the linear array


2. Write a program to accept N numbers from the user and store them in an array. Then, accept another number from the user and search that using Linear Search.


3. Write a program to accept N integers from the user and store them in an array. Sort the array in ascending order using Bubble sort. Then accept another number from the user, search whether that number exists in the array using Binary Search. If it does, display its index and if it doesn’t, then print that the number is not found in the array.


4. Write a menu driven program that implements the following operations on a   
doubly and Circular linked list :
•	Insert a new element at the beginning ,end and in-between the given list
•	Delete an existing element
•	Search an element
•	Display all the elements 


5. Write a menu driven program that implements the following operations on a   
Stack(either implement as Linear array and as Linked list) :
•	Push 
•	Pop  
•	Display Top of the stack
